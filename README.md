# JStimeZoneConverter

This code assumes that you have an HTML form with three inputs: "input-time" (the input time in HH:MM format), "input-timezone" (the input time zone), and "output-timezone" (the output time zone). It also assumes that you have an HTML element with an ID of "output-time" that will display the converted time.

To use this code, you would call the convertTime() function whenever the user submits the form. The function gets the user's input values, converts the input time to UTC, converts the UTC time to the output time zone, and updates the output time in the HTML element.

Note that this code is a very basic example of a time zone converter and doesn't handle all possible edge cases. Depending on your use case, you may need to add additional error handling or validation.
